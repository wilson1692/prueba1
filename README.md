I know this page is Not well structured, Because I used Django Forms in here Instead of HTML tags.
So, I will Structure it in later updates becuase it requires sometime.

After Creating a Entry to Db for Pervious Question you Filled

Here we see all Questions inside that Question Paper.

We can Also add New Questions to that Question Paper as Well.


## Flaws Left Intentionally
HahaüòÇ _I know I know_ __What you are thinking !!__ üòÅ. 
Yup I left something, Because I was daam to lazy to Change or Port them

#### Delete Request 
I used Get request to delete a Particular question as Well as Whole Question Paper. 
Therefore you know anyone can Delete it just by entering the Right URL Instead or a Delete Request.

I Could have Changed it into POST Request with csrf token But for That I had to create New forms and pages etc. 
So, that I can Send and Recieve a POST Request, Whereas as it is Now I have deleted Questions and Question papers 
Simply by using a <a> tag by sending them to that particular api link.
  
So Here you have it 
  The Flaw I left intentionally ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
  
#### And Feel Free to Imporve it 
  Its always appericiated
